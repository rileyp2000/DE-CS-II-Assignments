EightQueensDisplay

	Fields: numRow, numCol, height,width,colors for text and panels, frame, container panels, [][] of chessSquarePanels

	Constructors:
		1 constructor that creates a blank board, 1 that creates the board with a given solution
			adds the three panels to the frame, and if it is given a solution passes that to the overloaded buildGrid
	
	Methods:
		buildFrame():
			Creates the frame with a size and default close operation and returns it
		
		buildHeaderPanel(String s):
			Creates the header panel, with the specified string as the header text and returns it
		
		buildGridPanel():
			Creates a chess board without any queens on it and returns it.
			Uses a grid layout with ChessSquarePanels, assigns values to the [][]
		
		buildGridPanel(int[][] solutions):
			Creates a chess board with the provided solution on it and returns it.
			Uses a grid layout with ChessSquarePanels, assigns values to the [][]
		
		buildFooterPanel():
			  Creates a new panel with three buttons that will reset the board, display the initial solution, and find all the 
			  solutions recursively
		
		updatePanel(int r, int c):
			Updates the ChessSquarePanel at the spot to the other state (from displaying a queen to not or vice versa)
		
		currentBoard():
			Updates the onBoard list to reflect the current board
			
		reset():
			Makes it a blank board
		
		presetSolution():
			draws the preset solution on the board
			
		recursiveFind(int r, int c):
			Finds all 92 solutions to the 8 queens problem
			Algorithm:
				if c < 8
					for loop over all the indicies of the column
						*For backtracking purposes* if something has already been placed in the row, remove it 
						if you can place it at the spot, place it and recurse on the next column
						otherwise, do nothing
				if there are 8 queens on the board
					display a win
					otherwise, remove from the column and continue recursing backwards
